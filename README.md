2nd Year Theoretical Physics Computational Project (UCL)

This project consists of a logbook and a formal report. The logbook is a Jupyter notebook with the functions that I wrote to generate the results in for my formal report. The logbook's methodology and final results are outlined in the formal report and I recieved a grade of 80% for this project.
